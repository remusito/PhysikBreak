# **App Name**: PhysikBreak

## Core Features:

- Realistic Physics Engine: Simulate real-world physics for the ball's movement and interactions with the paddle and blocks. Adjust restitution and friction coefficients as a tool to create realistic bounces and movements.
- Dynamic Brick Layouts: Generate a unique brick layout for each level.
- Paddle Control: Implement touch-based paddle control with adjustable sensitivity.
- Score Tracking: Record the player's score based on the number of bricks broken and display the score.
- Level Progression: Create a sequence of increasingly challenging levels.
- Visual Feedback: Particles explode when ball makes contact with the blocks.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to convey energy and dynamics.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E5F5F9) for a clean, unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Vivid green (#90EE90) for paddle highlight, and special power-ups.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for a techy, modern feel in headlines and UI elements.
- Use flat, geometric icons for power-ups and in-game elements.
- Maintain a clean, uncluttered layout to keep the focus on the ball and bricks.
- Subtle animations for brick breaking and power-up activation to provide visual feedback.
